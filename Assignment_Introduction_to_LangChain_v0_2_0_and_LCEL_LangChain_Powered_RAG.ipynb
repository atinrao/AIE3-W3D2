This allows for more sophisticated and customized behavior in applications that leverage language models, enhancing their capability to process and respond to user inputs and other data in a meaningful way.\\n\\nIn summary, LCEL is a powerful tool within the LangChain ecosystem that helps developers build more advanced and customized language model applications by providing a structured way to define and evaluate expressions and logic.' response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 171, 'prompt_tokens': 27, 'total_tokens': 198}, 'model_name': 'gpt-4o', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_f4e629d0a5', 'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None} id='run-c3d4607d-3b4b-4f5d-a71f-d151a063e6dc-0' usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 27, 'output_tokens': 171, 'total_tokens': 198}\n"
